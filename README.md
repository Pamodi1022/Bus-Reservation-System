# Bus Reservation System

This project aims to create a user-friendly and efficient platform for customers to book and manage their bus tickets online.

1.	Customer Registration: Customers can create an account by providing their name, mobile number, email ID, city, and age.
2.	Bus Registration: Bus operators can register their buses by entering details such as bus number, total seats, starting and ending points, starting time, and fare.
3.	Bus Search: Customers can search for available buses based on their travel preferences.
4.	Seat Reservation: Customers can reserve seats on their desired buses. Upon successful reservation, the customer and the next customer in the queue for that seat will be notified via message.
5.	Reservation Management: Customers can cancel their reservations at any time. Cancellation notifications will be sent to the customer and the next customer in the queue for that seat.
6.	Reservation Display: All reservations will be displayed for easy management and tracking.
   
Data Structures and Algorithms:
1.	Data Structures: I will analyze the scenario and create appropriate data structures to store and manage customer and bus information. I will also determine valid operations for these data structures.
2.	Stack Operations: I will critically review how a stack can be used to implement different operations in the reservation system.
3.	Shortest Path Algorithms: I will analyze and illustrate two shortest path algorithms to help XYZ Pvt Ltd visit all customers through the shortest path within a day.
4.	Sorting Algorithms: I will sort customers based on age using two different sorting algorithms and compare their performances.
   
Implementation and Testing:
1.	Java Programming: I will implement the Bus Reservation System using Java programming and the selected data structures and their valid operations.
2.	Error Handling: Suitable error handling mechanisms will be incorporated to ensure a robust and reliable system.
3.	Testing: I will test the application using appropriate test cases and provide evidence of the test cases and results.
4.	Imperative ADTs and Object Orientation: I will discuss the relationship between imperative ADTs and object orientation, stating whether I agree or disagree with the given view and justifying my answer.
   
Encapsulation and Information Hiding:
1.	Imperative ADT Definition: I will specify the abstract data type for storing customer details from oldest to newest and implement it using Java programming.
2.	Complexity Analysis: I will critically analyze the complexity of the chosen ADT algorithm.
3.	Encapsulation and Information Hiding: I will examine the advantages of encapsulation and information hiding when using the selected ADT for the given scenario.
   
Algorithmic Efficiency and Trade-offs:
1.	Asymptotic Analysis: I will evaluate how asymptotic analysis can be used to assess the effectiveness of an algorithm.
2.	Efficiency Measurement: I will discuss at least two ways to measure the efficiency of an algorithm with relevant examples.
3.	Trade-offs in ADT Implementation: I will explain the trade-offs that exist when using an ADT for implementing programs, supporting my answer with specific examples.
4.	Benefits of Independent Data Structures: I will evaluate the benefits of using independent data structures for implementing programs.
This project showcases my skills in data structures, algorithms, Java programming, and problem-solving. By implementing a Bus Reservation System, I aim to demonstrate my ability to design and develop efficient and user-friendly software solutions.
